# AI/ML Integration Guidelines

## Architecture
- **Processing Pipeline**: FastAPI backend handles all ML workloads
- **Computer Vision**: Fruit recognition, quality assessment, quantity estimation  
- **Predictive Analytics**: Harvest forecasting, yield prediction, weather correlation
- **Model Management**: Version tracking, confidence scores, fallback handling

## FastAPI Service Structure
- Separate FastAPI service from Next.js app
- Handle image processing, computer vision, and ML inference
- Async processing with status tracking in database
- Proper error handling and timeout management

## Database Integration
```sql
ai_analysis: 
  id, photo_id, fruit_type_detected, confidence_score,
  quantity_estimated, quality_metrics (jsonb),
  processing_time, model_version, created_at
```

## Implementation Notes
- Use confidence thresholds before accepting AI results
- Implement fallback mechanisms for failed analysis
- Track model performance and version compatibility
- Provide user feedback during processing
